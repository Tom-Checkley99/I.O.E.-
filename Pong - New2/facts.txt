Emissions like carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouses gases will remain in the atmosphere for many years making impossible to eliminate global warming for several decades.
According to IPCC 2007 report, sea levels will rise by 7-23 inches by the end of this century due to global warming.
Since 1880, the average temperature has risen by 1.4-Fahrenheit degrees.

The Arctic ice is melting rapidly. By 2040 the region is expected to have a completely ice-free summer, or even earlier.
The Montana Glacier National Park has only 25 glaciers instead of 150 that were there in the year 1910.
Due to global warming and pollution, coral reefs are suffering the worst bleaching with the highest dying record since 1980.
Global warming that is causing extreme weather changes has shown its implications in the way of forest fires, heat waves and severe tropical storms throughout the world.
Humans are emitting more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, faster than the absorbing rates of plants and the oceans.
Around 100 million people live with 3 feet of sea level and many cities of the world are located near such vulnerable coastal areas.
Melting of glaciers will cause sea levels to rise on one hand and water shortages in areas that depend on natural sources of water.
More than 1 million species have become extinct due to disappearing habitats, ecosystems acidic oceans all caused due to global warming.
The global warming will completely alter the oceanâ€™s conveyer belt which will cause a mini ice age in Europe.
Increasing temperatures will release more greenhouse gases, unlock methane, and cause more evaporation of water.
2000-2009 has been the hottest decade periods of the earth.
The rate at which carbon dioxide is being dumped into the environment is 1000 tons per second until the 2011 records.

Human activities release around 37 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.
Since the industrial revolution in 1700, the level of carbon dioxide on earth has increased by 34%.
By the year 2100, the average temperature will rise by 5.8 degrees as a result of global warming.
Each year of the 21st century ranks amongst 14 hottest years since 1880.
Between 2000-2100, the heat-related deaths will rise by 150,000.
Global warming is causing colder areas of the world to become hotter, thereby becoming more vulnerable to diseases.
A failure in preventing global warming can cause a major economic collapse causing 20% of global domestic output to fix.
